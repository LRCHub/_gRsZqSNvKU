HELLO DARKNESS. MY OLD FRIEND
I'VE COME TO TALK WITH YOU AGAIN
BECAUSE A VISION SOFTLY CREEPING
LEFT ITS SEEDS WHILE I WAS
SLEEPING
AND THE VISION THAT WAS PLANTED
IN MY BRAIN STILL REMAINS
WITHIN THE SOUND OF SILENCE
IN RESTLESS DREAMS I WALKED
ALONE
NARROW STREETS OF COBBLESTONE
'NEATH THE HALO OF A STREET LAMP
I TURNED MY COLLAR TO THE COLD
AND DAMP
WHEN MY EYES WERE STABBED
BY THE FLASH OF A NEON LIGHT
THAT SPLIT THE NIGHT
AND TOUCHED THE SOUND OF SILENCE
AND IN THE NAKED LIGHT I SAW
TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE, MAYBE MORE
PEOPLE TALKING WITHOUT SPEAKING
PEOPLE HEARING WITHOUT LISTENING
PEOPLE WRITING SONGS THAT
VOICES NEVER SHARE
AND NO ONE DARED
DISTURB THE SOUND OF SILENCE
"FOOLS, " SAID I. "YOU DO NOT
KNOW
SILENCE LIKE A CANCER GROWS.
HEAR MY WORDS THAT I MIGHT
TEACH YOU.
TAKE MY ARMS THAT I MIGHT REACH
YOU."
BUT MY WORDS LIKE SILENT
RAINDROPS FELL
AND ECHOED IN THE WELLS OF
SILENCE
AND THE PEOPLE BOWED AND PRAYED
TO THE NEON GOD THEY MADE.
AND THE SIGN FLASHED OUT ITS
WARNING
IN THE WORDS THAT IT WAS FORMING
AND THE SIGN SAID.
THE WORDS OF THE PROPHETS ARE
WRITTEN
ON THE SUBWAY WALLS
AND TENEMENT HALLS
AND WHISPERED IN THE SOUND OF
SILENCE
