[00:21.33] Hello darkness, my old friend
[00:26.88] I've come to talk with you again
[00:32.75] Because a vision softly creeping
[00:38.84] Left its seeds while I was sleeping
[00:44.80] And the vision that was planted in my brain
[00:53.59] Still remains
[00:57.92] Within the sound of silence
[01:11.42] 
[01:05.28] In restless dreams, I walked alone
[01:10.46] Narrow streets of cobblestone
[01:16.52] 'Neath the halo of a street lamp
[01:22.41] I turned my collar to the cold and damp
[01:28.32] When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
[01:36.79] That split the night
[01:41.27] And touched the sound of silence
[01:57.27] 
[01:48.35] And in the naked light, I saw
[01:53.74] Ten thousand people, maybe more
[01:59.61] People talking without speaking
[02:05.45] People hearing without listening
[02:10.20] People writing songs that voices never shared
[02:19.49] And no one dared
[02:23.36] Disturb the sound of silence
[02:37.36] 
[02:30.78] "Fools" said I, "You do not know
[02:36.34] Silence like a cancer grows
[02:41.78] Hear my words that I might teach you
[02:47.42] Take my arms that I might reach you"
[02:53.05] But my words, like silent raindrops fell
[03:03.46] And echoed in the wells of silence
[03:20.46] 
[03:11.51] And the people bowed and prayed
[03:17.25] To the neon god they made
[03:22.65] And the sign flashed out its warning
[03:28.23] In the words that it was forming
[03:33.68] Then the sign said, "The words on the prophets are written on the subway walls
[03:43.14] In tenement halls"
[03:47.19] And whispered in the sound of silence
